Linear Structure Extraction in Images: Implementing Laplacian and Sobel Operators with Hough Transform

The project focuses on linear structure extraction from an image using a
combination of the Laplacian operator, Sobel operator, and Hough transform. The
goal is to identify and extract prominent linear features from an input image and
generate meaningful output, showcasing the potential applications of these
image processing techniques. The project aims to enhance the understanding
and implementation of fundamental image processing algorithms for feature
extraction.

The project begins with the application of the Laplacian operator to the input
image, "building.raw". The Laplacian operator is employed to detect
zero-crossing points, emphasizing areas with significant changes in intensity.
This step is crucial for identifying potential locations of linear structures within the
image.

Following the Laplacian operation, the Sobel operator is applied to obtain the
gradient at all pixels in the image. The Sobel operator is effective in highlighting
edges and gradients, providing valuable information about the image's structural
features. The combination of Laplacian and Sobel operators serves as a robust
preprocessing step for identifying potential linear structures.

The processed data generates an edge image where a pixel is considered an
edge point if it is a zero-crossing point and its gradient is greater than or equal to
a specified threshold. This thresholding step helps in obtaining a clean edge
image by filtering out noise and retaining only significant edge information.

The project's highlight lies in implementing the Hough transform algorithm. This
algorithm extracts lines from the edge image, identifying prominent linear
structures present in the input image. The Hough transform is particularly
powerful in detecting lines, and its application in this project emphasizes its
importance in computer vision and image analysis.

Source Code Overview:
The source code is written in C++ and avoids the use of external libraries,
providing a clear understanding of the underlying algorithms. The code is
well-structured, with modular functions for reading and writing raw image data,
applying the Laplacian and Sobel operators, and performing the Hough
transform. It adheres to best coding practices, making it accessible for learning
and experimentation.

Output Images:
The project produces four distinct images:

Original Building Image ("original_building.raw"):
This image represents the original input image, serving as a reference for
comparison.

Laplacian Output Image ("laplacian_output.raw"):
The output of the Laplacian operator highlights zero-crossing points and regions
with significant intensity changes.

Sobel Output Image ("sobel_output.raw"):
The output of the Sobel operator emphasizes gradients and edges within the
image.

Edge Image ("edge_image.raw"):
The final edge image is where pixels are considered edge points based on
zero-crossing and gradient threshold criteria. This image effectively highlights
potential linear structures.

In conclusion, this project provides a hands-on exploration of essential
image-processing techniques for linear structure extraction. The source code is a
valuable resource for learning and implementing these algorithms from scratch,
offering insights into the intricacies of image analysis. The output images visually
demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented techniques in identifying and
extracting linear features from the input image.

This project serves as a foundation for further exploration into computer vision,
pattern recognition, and image processing. It empowers individuals to understand
and apply fundamental algorithms, fostering a deeper appreciation for the role of
image processing in various real-world applications.
